NOT_WORKING:
1) The min-check for user password from controller side didnt work even though password size was 2

//TODO- add handler for controller validation given by gpt

2) When login is done using only email and password, giving generic 500 error instead of logging in


3) Not a big issue:
{
       "message": "An unexpected error occurred",
       "data": {
           "path": "/tasks/1/start",
           "details": "Task with task id : \"1\" is already logged as Started.",
           "error": "Task Already marked as Started.",
           "timestamp": "2025-08-06T15:03:56.4703001",
           "status": 409
       }
   }
   when old jwt of deleted user passed for marking start task for id=1, most probably happening because the data of the user deleted was same as the new one,
   solution might be to check how to invalidate the old token having same dataof the new user from the old user.




WORKING:
1) RE signup of same user gives error, but status can be improved currently 500- Improved now.
2)












Solved:
1) Re signup gives error code 500, should be-- Solved,
Solution- added @Order(Ordered.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE) in the user's controller advice

2) After login,token not being sent to header section--Solved
Solution - Return type response entity format issue in controller
